/*
We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.

The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Å~ 186 = 7254, containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.

Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.
HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include it once in your sum.


Answer:
*/

/*
So we need a number of 9 digits that contain only one time the digits between 1 and 9.

So a number that include a 0 is not pandigital.

log 10 + 1 to get the length of a natural integer.
